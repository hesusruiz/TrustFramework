// This is a special "trusted attesting" resolver, in the sense that some record info associated
// to a node can not be set by the owner of the node, but it has to be set by the
// owner of the parent node. In other words, the parent node "attests" that the information associated
// to a given node is correct (under the responsibility of the parent node owner).
// It acts as an extension to the assignment of a name to a node (setSubnodeOwner), which can only be
// made by the parent node and under its responsibility.
// This means that anyone resolving the info from the node name knows that the info has been verified
// by the owner of the parent node. This is extremely useful in many real-world environments where
// Trusted Entities are required to attest some other entities.
// In addition to the trusted info, there is "normal" information that can be set by the owner of the node.
//
// In particular:
// Attested info by the parent: DID, name and active
// Self-managed info: DIDDocument (the parent can set initially that info if desired, but it can be changed later)
